# <HTML-CSS-GIT Code Rerfractor>

## Description

Our client has asked us to make a codebase that meets acessibility standards. Our codebase is full of non-semantic elements such as divs.

 Semantic elements are important because they inform devolopers and people with disabilites the meaning of the code. 
 
 Comments are also necessary to let other devolopers know the thought process or reasoning of the code.

# Purpose

To ensure a effiecent web page we must take a look at our code. It is important to maintain an organized code that is clear, concise, and accessibile to all.

 Refreactoring is a process that transforms our exsisting code to be more comprehensible. This Code Refreactoring project aims to contribute by cleaning up unecessary code. 

## Process

 We can define different parts of the web page using semantic elements in the HTML. Our code is full of divs, so I've replaced them by the apropriate tags. 
 
 Once we change the tags, I have adjusted the css style sheet accordingly. I have also eliminated unecessary code by consolidating the selectors that had the same content.
 
 I included alt in img tags to be more user-friendly. I added more spacing in the code to be comprehensible and readible. I have also changed the title into an apropriate name. 



## Conclusion

This code refractoring project illustrated how important it is for devolopers to have a clear organize code. 

Semantic elements and adding comments are essential to provide devolopers the necessary information of the code. 

This has also taught me the importance of inclusion and acessibility for people with disabilites with tech. 

This project has allowed me to become more familiar with HTML format and helped me visualize my work with css. I appreciate this project for helping me grow as a junior devoloper.
